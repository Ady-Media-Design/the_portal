# The Portal : A Journey Beyond Reality
### Discovering Truth in a Virtual Universe

In a world where reality blurs with the digital unknown, Ady — a visionary designer — stumbles upon a secret buried deep within the Internet’s unseen layers. Alongside his fearless partner, Xara, they are pulled into a vortex of pixels and code, a dazzling yet perilous realm inhabited by alien beings and otherworldly landscapes. This isn’t just a digital illusion; it's a parallel universe with secrets of its own. As they navigate through this surreal dimension, Ady and Xara realize that they themselves are part of its fabric, actors in a cosmic mystery. Their mission is clear: escape this virtual labyrinth and discover their true identities... but the truth might reshape everything they thought they knew about their existence.

## Creative Process & Collaboration with AI

The story is brought to life through a collaborative process combining Ady’s vision with the generative powers of AI. From conceptual art to story development, AI tools help craft a world that is vibrant, strange, and endlessly captivating. However, this is just the beginning, and the project welcomes contributions from creative individuals interested in bringing the story to life through animation. We invite anyone skilled in short animation (1–8 seconds) at 1080p resolution to join this project. Ady can provide high-resolution images (1080p to 4K) as a foundation for animators to use in generating dynamic scenes.

All are welcome to join in creating "The Portal" and shaping this unique adventure into a stunning visual experience.

Character face consistency is mandatory.
